# Fullstack Bootcamp Journey
Welcome to my repository! This space is dedicated to tracking my progress as I dive into the exciting world of fullstack web development through a Udemy Fullstack Bootcamp. Here, you'll find my projects, exercises, and notes as I learn and grow as a developer.

About This Repository
Iâ€™m embarking on a journey to become a fullstack developer, and this repository serves as both a portfolio and a learning log. Itâ€™s where Iâ€™ll store code from lessons, personal experiments, and mini-projects as I work through the bootcamp curriculum. My goal is to build a strong foundation in both frontend and backend development while documenting my progress along the way.

Goals
Master HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for frontend development.
Learn frameworks like React, Node.js, and Express for building dynamic applications.
Understand databases (e.g., MongoDB, SQL) and how to connect them to my apps.
Gain hands-on experience by completing real-world projects.
Track my growth and reflect on challenges and successes.
Repository Structure
/projects: Contains completed projects from the bootcamp and personal side projects.
/exercises: Small coding exercises and practice files from lessons.
/notes: Key takeaways, cheatsheets, or concepts Iâ€™m learning.
/resources: Useful links, tools, or references I come across during the bootcamp.
Current Progress
Started: [Insert start date, e.g., March 2025]
Current Focus: [e.g., HTML/CSS basics, JavaScript fundamentals, etc.]
Latest Project: [e.g., "Building a responsive landing page" or "To-do list app"]
